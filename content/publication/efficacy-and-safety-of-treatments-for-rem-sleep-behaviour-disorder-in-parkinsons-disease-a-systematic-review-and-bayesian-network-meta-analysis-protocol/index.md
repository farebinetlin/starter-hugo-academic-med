  Introduction: Sleep disorders are the main non-motor characteristics of
  Parkinson's disease (PD). The quality of life is significantly impacted by
  rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). It is not clearly evidenced
  in the literature that some medications can reduce the dream activities of
  patients with PD and RBD and improve sleep quality. And, they have side
  effects that may increase the severity of this disease. To further understand
  which medication has better efficacy and fewer adverse effects for patients
  with PD and RBD, it is necessary to perform a network meta-analysis.


  Methods and analysis: This protocol is performed accordingly to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.A thorough literature selection will be conducted up to September 2021 using PubMed, Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and Embase. We will not only include randomised controlled trials, but prospective, retrospective cohort, case-control, nested case-control, case-cohort, cross-sectional and case series. We will use the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias. Pairwise and network meta-analyses will be conducted using the R netmeta package and Stata V.14.0. The relative ranking probability of the best intervention will be estimated using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Additionally, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, quality assessment and publication bias analysis will be performed.


  Ethics and dissemination: No research ethics approval is required for this systematic review, as no confidential patient data will be used. We will disseminate our findings through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and conference presentations, and our review will support development of a BMJ Rapid Recommendations providing contextualised clinical guidance based on this body of evidence.
