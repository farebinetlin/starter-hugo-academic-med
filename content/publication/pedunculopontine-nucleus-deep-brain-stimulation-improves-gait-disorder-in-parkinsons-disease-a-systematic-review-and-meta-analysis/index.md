abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has
  been proposed as a treatment strategy for gait disorder in patients with
  Parkinson's disease (PD). We thus performed a systematic review and
  meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials to assess the
  effect of this treatment on gait disorder in patients with PD. We
  systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, Wan Fang and WIP
  for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials (published before July 29,
  2014; no language restrictions) comparing PPN-DBS with other treatments. We
  assessed pooled data using a random effects model and a fixed effects model.
  Of 130 identified studies, 14 were eligible and were included in our analysis
  (N = 82 participants). Compared to those presurgery, the Unified Parkinson
  Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 27-30 scores for patients were lowered by PPN-DBS
  [3.94 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.23 to 6.65)]. The UPDRS 13 and 14
  scores did not improve with levodopa treatment [0.43 (- 0.35 to 1.20); 0.35 (-
  0.50 to 1.19)], whereas the UPDRS 27-30 scores could be improved by the
  therapy [1.42 (95% CI 0.34 to 2.51)]. The Gait and Falls Questionnaire and
  UPDRS 13 and 14 scores showed significant improvements after PPN-DBS under the
  medication-off (MED-OFF) status [15.44 (95% CI = 8.44 to 22.45); 1.57 (95% CI
  = 0.84 to 2.30); 1.34 (95% CI = 0.84 to 1.84)]. PPN-DBS is a potential
  therapeutic target that could improve gait and fall disorders in patients with
  PD. Our findings will help improve the clinical application of DBS in PD
  patients with gait disorder.
