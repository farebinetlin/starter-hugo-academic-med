abstract: "Background: Movement fluctuations are the main complication of
  Parkinson's disease (PD) patients receiving long-term levodopa (L-dopa)
  treatment. We compared and ranked the efficacy and safety of dopamine agonists
  (DAs) with regard to motor fluctuations by using a Bayesian network
  meta-analysis (NMA) to quantify information from randomized controlled trials
  (RCTs). Methods and Findings: We carried out a systematic review and
  meta-analysis, and only RCTs comparing DAs for advanced PD were included.
  Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were
  systematically searched for relevant studies published until January 2021. Two
  reviewers independently extracted individual study data and evaluated studies
  for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Network meta-analyses
  using a Bayesian framework were used to calculate the related parameters. The
  pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes were efficacy (\"ON\" time
  without troublesome dyskinesia, \"OFF\" time, \"ON\" time, \"UPDRS-III,\" and
  \"UPDRS-II\") and safety [treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and other
  adverse events] of DAs. The results are presented as the surface under the
  cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve. A total of 20 RCTs assessing 6,560 patients
  were included. The general DA effects were ranked from high to low with
  respect to the amount of \"ON\" time without troublesome dyskinesia as
  follows: apomorphine (SUCRA = 97.08%), pramipexole_IR (probability = 79.00%),
  and ropinirole_PR (SUCRA = 63.92%). The general safety of DAs was ranked from
  high to low with respect to TEAE as follows: placebo (SUCRA = 74.49%),
  pramipexole_ER (SUCRA = 63.6%), sumanirole (SUCRA = 54.07%), and rotigotine
  (SUCRA = 53.84%). Conclusions: This network meta-analysis shows that
  apomorphine increased \"ON\" time without troublesome dyskinesia and decreased
  \"OF\" time for advanced PD patients. The addition of pramipexole, ropinirole,
  or rotigotine to levodopa treatment in advanced PD patients with motor
  fluctuations increased \"ON\" time without troublesome dyskinesia, improved
  the UPDRS III scores, and ultimately ameliorated the UPDRS II scores, thereby
  maximizing its benefit. This NMA of pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine
  represents an effective treatment option and has an acceptable safety profile
  in patients with advanced PD. "
