abstract: "To compare the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and
  MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) in parkinsonian tremor. We performed a
  network meta-analysis based on a Bayesian framework. We searched the
  literature for articles published between January 1990 and October 2020 using
  three databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews). A total of 24 studies were included in our analysis,
  comprising data from 784 participants. Our findings revealed similar efficacy
  of DBS and MRIgFUS in parkinsonian tremor suppression. Compared with internal
  globus pallidus (GPi)-MRIgFUS, GPi-DBS -1.84 (-6.44, 2.86), pedunculopontine
  nucleus (PPN)_DBS -3.28 (-9.28, 2.78), PPN and caudal zona incerta (cZI)-DBS
  0.40 (-6.16, 6.87), subthalamic nucleus (STN)_DBS 0.89 (-3.48, 5.30), STN and
  cZI-DBS 1.99 (-4.74, 8.65), ventral intermediate nucleus(VIM)_DBS 1.75 (-2.87,
  6.48), VIM_FUS 0.72 (-5.27, 6.43), cZI-DBS 0.27 (-4.75, 5.36) were no
  significantly difference. Compared with VIM-MRIgFUS, GPi-DBS -2.55(-6.94,
  2.21), GPi-FUS -0.72 (-6.43, 5.27), PPN_DBS -4.01(-9.97, 2.11), PPN and
  cZI-DBS -0.32 (-6.73, 6.36), STN_DBS 0.16 (-3.98, 4.6), STN and cZI-DBS
  1.31(-5.18,7.87), VIM-DBS 1.00(-3.41, 5.84)and cZI-DBS -0.43 (-5.07, 4.68)
  were no significantly difference. With respect to the results for the
  treatment of motor symptoms, GPi-DBS, GPi-MRIgFUS, STN-DBS and cZI-DBS were
  significantly more efficacious than baseline (GPi-DBS 15.24 (5.79, 24.82),
  GPi-MRIgFUS 13.46 (2.46, 25.10), STN-DBS 19.62 (12.19, 27.16), cZI-DBS 14.18
  (1.73, 26.89). The results from the surface under the cumulative ranking
  results showed that STN-DBS ranked first, followed by combined PPN and
  cZI-DBS, and PPN-DBS ranked last. MRIgFUS, an efficacious intervention for
  improving parkinsonian tremor, has not demonstrated to be inferior to DBS in
  parkinsonian tremor suppression. Hence, clinicians should distinguish
  individual patients' symptoms to ensure that the appropriate intervention and
  therapeutic approach are applied."
