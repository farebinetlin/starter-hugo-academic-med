abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) not only affects the quality of life of
  patients but also poses a heavy burden on their families. Therefore, it is
  essential to prevent the occurrence of SCI; for unpreventable SCI, it is
  critical to develop effective treatments. In recent years, various major
  breakthroughs have been made in cell therapy to protect and regenerate the
  damaged spinal cord via various mechanisms such as immune regulation,
  paracrine signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM) modification, and lost cell
  replacement. Nevertheless, many recent studies have shown that the cell
  therapy has many disadvantages, such as tumorigenicity, low survival rate, and
  immune rejection. Because of these disadvantages, the clinical application of
  cell therapy is limited. In recent years, the role of exosomes in various
  diseases and their therapeutic potential have attracted much attention. The
  same is true for exosomal noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which do not encode
  proteins but affect transcriptional and translational processes by targeting
  specific mRNAs. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of exosomes
  obtained from different cell sources in the treatment of SCI and the
  regulatory role and therapeutic potential of exosomal ncRNAs. This review also
  discusses the future opportunities and challenges, proposing that exosomes and
  exosomal ncRNAs might be promising tools for the treatment of SCI.
