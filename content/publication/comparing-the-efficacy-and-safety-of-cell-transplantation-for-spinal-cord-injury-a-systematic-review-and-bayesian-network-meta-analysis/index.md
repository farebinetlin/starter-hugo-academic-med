  Abstract

  Objective: Lokomat and wearable exoskeleton-assisted walking (EAW) have not been directly compared previously. To conduct a network meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials to assess locomotor abilities achieved with two different types of robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) program in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).


  Methods: Three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, were systematically searched for randomized and non-randomized controlled trials published before August 2021, which assessed locomotor abilities after RAGT.


  Results: Of 319 studies identified for this review, 12 studies were eligible and included in our analysis. Studies from 2013 to 2021 were covered and contained 353 valid data points (N-353) on patients with SCI receiving wearable EWA and Lokomat training. In the case of wearable EAW, the 10-m walk test (10-MWT) distance and speed scores significantly increased [distance: 0.85 (95% CI = 0.35, 1.34); speed: -1.76 (95% CI = -2.79, -0.73)]. The 6-min walk test (6-MWT) distance [-1.39 (95% CI = -2.01, -0.77)] and the timed up and go (TUG) test significantly increased [(1.19 (95% CI = 0.74, 1.64)], but no significant difference was observed in the walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI-II) [-0.33 (95% CI = -0.79, 0.13)]. Among the patients using Lokomat, the 10-MWT-distance score significantly increased [-0.08 (95% CI = -0.14, -0.03)] and a significant increase in the WISCI-II was found [1.77 (95% CI = 0.23, 3.31)]. The result of network meta-analysis showed that the probability of wearable EAW to rank first and that of Lokomat to rank second was 89 and 47%, respectively, in the 10-MWT speed score, while that of Lokomat to rank first and wearable EAW to rank second was 73 and 63% in the WISCI-II scores.


  Conclusion: Lokomat and wearable EAW had effects on the performance of locomotion abilities, namely, distance, speed, and function. Wearable EAW might lead to better outcomes in walking speed compared with that in the case of Lokomat.
